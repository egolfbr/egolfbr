## About Me 

I graduated from Miami University - OH with a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering. I am researching in the areas of electronic warfare and machine learning.
My most used skills are: 
  1. Python
  2. Java 
  3. MATLAB
  4. C++/C
  5. Git
  6. Arduino/Raspberry Pi

I have many different interests such as digital signal processing, image processing, FPGAs and embedded systems, and machine learning.

## Projects 
Here you can find projects that I really enjoyed. 

**[Keras Model Visualizer](https://github.com/egolfbr/keras_visualizer)**<br>
**[CNN Radar Classification](https://github.com/egolfbr/cnn-classifier)**<br>
**[Keras XML Model Builder](https://github.com/egolfbr/keras-xml-model-builder)**<br>
**[Stock Market Comparison App](https://github.com/egolfbr/stock_portfolio_comparison)**<br>
**[Custom Machine Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/egolfbr/custom_ML)**<br>

Notes on projects:

- Keras model visualizer has a few bugs with the distribution which I am currently trying to iron out. Running your model through it may generate some errors like "InputLayer not supported" but it should still output your model. 

- CNN Radar Classification runs with clean data. That is, there is no noise. This means that the model trains to 100% accuracy which is unrealistic. Try adding white noise to be more realistic. 

- Keras XML builder is a work in progress and cannot handle complex models. 

Other projects that I am working on that do not have repositories: 
- Thesis Research in ML and Electronic Warfare (not public :slightly_frowning_face: ).

Projects that I would like to work on: 
- Breadboard Robot: A small robotics tutorial built around a half-size breadboard
- Arduino ECG
